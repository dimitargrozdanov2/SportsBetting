A simple betting system which has 2 modes - preview mode and edit mode.
Preview mode is for information only and nothing can be created/editted/deleted.

In preview mode the system can be changed to edit mode. In edit mode a new match can be added. It will automatically be created with a date and user cannot set any properties.

Each event can be editted. Delete option opens a new confirmation view.

In edit mode a user can return to preview mode.

In preview mode records are colored. Also a click on any of the odds on an event will console.log information.

Rooms for improvement:
1. Automatic automapper
2. More javascript and better styling on layout web page.
3. Console.log outputs to be logged on C# console.
4. Other
